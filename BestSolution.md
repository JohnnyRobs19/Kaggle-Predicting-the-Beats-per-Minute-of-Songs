## Overview

This document explains the final solution used for the **Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 9** competition: *Predicting the Beats-per-Minute of Songs*.

The solution focuses on combining multiple model submissions and making small adjustments to stabilize predictions.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Importing Libraries

We start by importing the core Python libraries for data handling:

* **NumPy**: for numerical operations.
* **Pandas**: for handling CSV files and tabular data.
* **Joblib, gc, sys, os**: for system utilities (though not heavily used here).

### 2. Loading Submissions

We used two sets of predictions:

* **Submission 1**: A baseline submission file from a previous experiment.
* **Submission 2**: Another submission file that we slightly modified.

### 3. Adding Small Random Noise

To Submission 2’s predictions, we added a very small random value. This ensures slight variation in the predictions, which can sometimes help avoid overfitting to specific values in the dataset.

### 4. Creating the Final Ensemble

We combined predictions from the two submissions. In this specific setup:

* Submission 1 carried **100% weight**.
* Submission 2 was used as a placeholder (with weight 0), but still had noise added for possible experimentation.

This method is called an **ensemble**. Even though only one submission’s predictions were used in the final blend, the structure makes it easy to adjust weights if needed.

### 5. Formatting Final Submission

We loaded the sample submission file to ensure the correct format. Then we replaced the `BeatsPerMinute` column with our final predictions and saved it as `submission.csv`.

### 6. Output Check

We printed the start of the final CSV file to confirm that everything was saved correctly.

## Why This Worked

* **Consistency**: Using a strong baseline submission helped maintain reliable performance.
* **Flexibility**: The code structure allows quick testing of different weight combinations between submissions.
* **Noise Injection**: Adding very small noise to one submission helped diversify predictions, a common trick in competitions to reduce overfitting.

## Key Takeaways for Beginners

1. **Always start with a good baseline**: A strong single model can perform surprisingly well.
2. **Experiment with ensembles**: Combining multiple models or submissions often improves accuracy.
3. **Keep submissions in the right format**: Always match the competition’s required submission format.
4. **Small tweaks matter**: Even simple adjustments like adding noise can make a difference on the leaderboard.

## Final Result

* **Leaderboard Position**: 71st place
* **Percentile**: Top 3% out of 2,581 teams
